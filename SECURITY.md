# Security Policy

I use Dependabot to keep this site updated as much as possible to keep up on
security best practices. However, if you see something egregious that should be 
fixed immediately, please feel free to file an issue. Please note that I am not 
super technical on security and stuff, so you may need to help provide some 
steps in the best way for me to fix it beyond just merging dependabot PRs!
