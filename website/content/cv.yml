        description: >
          I pitched the design system to stakeholders in engineering and design
          leadership, and&nbsp;got buy-in. With&nbsp;the Lightning Design System
          funded and a team formalized, I&nbsp;received a title change to
          clarify my role. I&nbsp;conducted design systems work
          (which&nbsp;included <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> design,
          visual&nbsp;design, frontend&nbsp;development,
          and&nbsp;documentation). I&nbsp;drafted the team vision and charter
          and worked closely with our team&rsquo;s people manager on planning
          and presenting our goals with the&nbsp;organization.

          I moved to the core team to work on design systems across the various
          products. I&nbsp;worked closely with other product designers to
          standardize and document the design language and specifications for
          mobile and web application&nbsp;designs.


          I helped invent design tokens, which&nbsp;became adopted by the
          industry as a best practice for scaling design in a&nbsp;system.

        dates: February 2012&ndash;December&nbsp;2014
        description: >
          On a small design team of 3, I&nbsp;worked on a product called Do
          which was a social productivity product. Because&nbsp;we were a small
          team, I&nbsp;was product designer, marketing&nbsp;designer,
          and&nbsp;web developer. I&nbsp;led the Android app design. I&nbsp;also
          created the style guide for the marketing website and web application,
          as&nbsp;well as guided the engineering team on <abbr
          title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> best practices. Additionally,
          I&nbsp;led some of the design features for the
          iPhone&nbsp;application.


          Prior to hiring a marketing designer, I&nbsp;took on those projects
          which included our assets for the app/play stores, social media
          channels, and&nbsp;microsites for our marketing videos.


          This product, owned&nbsp;by Salesforce, was&nbsp;sunset in 2014.
          The&nbsp;domain name was sold, so&nbsp;the Do that exists today is not
          the same&nbsp;product.
