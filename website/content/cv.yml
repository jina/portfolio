            I pitched the design system to stakeholders in engineering and
            design leadership, and got buy-in. With the Lightning Design System
            funded and a team formalized, I received a title change to clarify

            title="User Experience">UX</abbr> design, visual design,
            frontend development, and documentation). I drafted the team vision
            and charter and worked closely with our team's people manager on
            planning and presenting our goals with the organization.

            standardize and document the design language and specifications for
            mobile and web application designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I helped invent design tokens, which became adopted by the industry
            as a best practice for scaling design in a system.

          <p>
            On a small design team of 3, I worked on a product called Do which
            was a social productivity product. Because we were a small team, I
            was product designer, marketing designer, and web developer. I led
            the Android app design. I also created the style guide for the
            marketing website and web application, as well as guided the
            engineering team on <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>
            best practices. Additionally, I led some of the design features for
            the iPhone application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to hiring a marketing designer, I took on those projects which
            included our assets for the app/play stores, social media channels,
            and microsites for our marketing videos.
          </p>
          <p>
            This product, owned by Salesforce, was sunset in 2014. The domain
            name was sold, so the Do that exists today is not the same product.
