      description: >
        I was recruited by fellow former Salesforce employees who worked with me
        to join them at Amazon. They&nbsp;wanted me to recreate the success of
        the Salesforce Lightning Design System. In&nbsp;a
        contract-turned-full-time engagement, I&nbsp;worked closely with product
        designers by providing design direction for visuals and interactions.
        I&nbsp;also worked with engineers to ensure their <abbr
        title="CSS">CSS</abbr> was to specifications as well as guidance
        on&nbsp;accessibility.


        My role also included some design operations as well,
        including&nbsp;provisioning access to the design tools used on the team,
        project&nbsp;management, and&nbsp;providing education and
        workshops&nbsp;opportunities.


        During my time there, I&nbsp;built a React-based style guide with
        components and documentation for both the design and engineering
        organizations to&nbsp;use.

        Clarity is a design systems conference focused on how we work together.
        We&nbsp;provide tools and standards to scale across an increasing number
        of devices, platforms, and&nbsp;products. But&nbsp;real success comes
        when people align around a shared vision and language.
        Diverse&nbsp;perspectives for design, development, and&nbsp;product
        unite so more people can be a part of the conversation. At&nbsp;Clarity,
        we&nbsp;elevate our skills through multi-faceted **inclusion**,
        **empathy**, **technology**, **creativity**, and&nbsp;**collaboration**.

        Design Systems as a full-time job were beginning to become a norm.
        But&nbsp;there weren&rsquo;t too many resources or events dedicated to
        people like&nbsp;us.

      description: >
        I found myself using the word &ldquo;clarity&rdquo; a lot in my work.
        So&nbsp;in 2014, I&nbsp;bought _clarityconf.com_. But&nbsp;the first
        event wasn&rsquo;t until 2016. It&nbsp;allowed time to consider and plan
        what the event experience should&nbsp;be.

        I organized the conference mostly by myself, with&nbsp;a few volunteers
        and vendors that I directed which included designers, a&nbsp;sketch note
        artist, videographers, photographer, and&nbsp;more.


        The event had almost 300&nbsp;attendees.

        The third year, the&nbsp;attendee count grew to 500 and the event was in
        New York City. This&nbsp;was to meet the customer demands of an
        east-coast event. So&nbsp;I hired a part-time assistant.
        I&nbsp;workshopped with a consultant to develop the mission statement
        and principles. And&nbsp;I continued directing creative volunteers
        and&nbsp;vendors.

        However, with&nbsp;the pandemic, plans&nbsp;changed (from&nbsp;in-person

        This is some of the work I am most proud of. During&nbsp;my five and a
        half years at Salesforce, I&nbsp;had the opportunity to impact how one
        of the largest enterprise technology companies ship product&nbsp;design.

        I paired closely with engineering to architect and implement design
        tokens, which&nbsp;became an industry-standard way of scaling design
        systems across multiple platforms and devices. We&nbsp;also built an
        open-source tool called Theo to generate the&nbsp;tokens.


        During this time, I&nbsp;managed to convince the entire organization to
        move to a four-based metric&nbsp;system!

        variant: small
      description: >
        I pitched the design system to stakeholders in engineering and design
        leadership, and&nbsp;got buy-in. With&nbsp;the Lightning Design System
        funded and a team formalized, I&nbsp;received a title change to clarify
        my role. I&nbsp;conducted design systems work (which&nbsp;included <abbr
        title="User Experience">UX</abbr> design, visual&nbsp;design,
        frontend&nbsp;development, and&nbsp;documentation). I&nbsp;drafted the
        team vision and charter and worked closely with our team&rsquo;s people
        manager on planning and presenting our goals with the&nbsp;organization.


        Partnered with a researcher, we&nbsp;user-tested early and often with
        proof of concepts. We&nbsp;facilitated conversations with third-party
        <abbr title="application">app</abbr> developers to find pinpoints for
        the design system&nbsp;framework.


        Additionally, I&nbsp;led the <abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr>
        organization&rsquo;s evangelism and outreach efforts including being the
        Editor-in-chief for the team blog, the&nbsp;admin for the social media
        accounts, organizer&nbsp;of various meet ups and conference
        sponsorships, writing, speaking, and&nbsp;coaching both internal and
        external people on best practices using the design&nbsp;system.


        I also mentored designers to level up their skills in
        frontend&nbsp;development.

        While Sass was first to market, Less&nbsp;had become more popular with
        designers. Sass&rsquo;s website and brand was not inspiring designers to
        use it. Also, the&nbsp;brand was also controversial&nbsp;(sexist).

        I am a fan of using Sass to process my CSS. I&nbsp;was first introduced
        to it during my time working at Engine Yard. One&nbsp;day, one&nbsp;of
        the core team members tweeted his frustration with the design of the
        project. He&nbsp;suggested that it might be why designers were using a
        competitor instead. So&nbsp;I volunteered to lead the redesign of the
        brand and&nbsp;website.
