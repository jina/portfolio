      description: Clarity is a design systems conference focused on how we work together. We provide tools and standards to scale across an increasing number of devices, platforms, and products. But real success comes when people align around a shared vision and language. Diverse perspectives for design, development, and product unite so more people can be a part of the conversation. At Clarity, we elevate our skills through multi-faceted <strong>inclusion</strong>, <strong>empathy</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>collaboration</strong>.

      description: >
        In 2014, Jina decided to try their hand at organizing a conference. They decided to focus the event on design systems since that was their main interest. At the time, there were no other events that had this focus. “Clarity” seemed perfect for the name, as it was a word Jina found using quite often in their field.

        The inspiration for the design aesthetic is diamonds (because “clarity”).

        While Jina bought the website domain right away, it wasn’t until 2016 that they held the first event. They chose the newly-opened Alamo Drafthouse New Mission theatre in San Francisco. Jina enlisted a few folx to help them with a few items (see credits below). Otherwise, Jina executed everything else. This included planning, coordinating, operations, storing, transporting equipment/materials, packing swag bags, etc.

        To Jina’s delight, Richard Danne keynoted the event. He was the designer on the Nasa logo and Graphic Standards Manual from the worm logo era (the 70’s).

        After 2 years of self-organizing, Jina realized they needed help. The event was scaling faster than expected. So Jina hired a part-time assistant (Michael Morrison). He took on some of the vendor facilitation, paperwork, and volunteer coordination. Then Jina could focus on the content curation, creative direction, and event experience.

        The third event was in New York City at the SVA Theatre. The event had grown to 500 attendees.

        The event attendance had grown year over year. So this year, instead of an assistant, Jina partnered with Kickass Conferences. This will produce a higher-quality event.

        With the 2020 pandemic, the landscape of events has changed. The event has evolved into an online experience. They have hopes to provide a hybrid experience in future years. This would combine the online and in-person experience.

      description: Jina was a fan of using Sass to process their CSS. They were first introduced to it during their time working at Engine Yard. One day, one of the core team members tweeted his frustration with the design of the project. He suggested that it might be why designers were using a competitor instead. So Jina volunteered to lead the redesign of the brand and website.
