          I was recruited by fellow former Salesforce employees who worked with
          me to join them at Amazon. They wanted me to recreate the success of
          the Salesforce Lightning Design System. In a contract-turned-full-time
          engagement, I worked closely with product designers by providing
          design direction for visuals and interactions. I also worked with
          engineers to ensure their <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> was to
          specifications as well as guidance on accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role also included some design operations as well, including
          provisioning access to the design tools used on the team, project
          management, and providing education and workshops opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time there, I built a React-based style guide with
          components and documentation for both the design and engineering
          organizations to use.

          Clarity is a design systems conference focused on how we work
          together. We provide tools and standards to scale across an increasing
          number of devices, platforms, and products. But real success comes
          when people align around a shared vision and language. Diverse
          perspectives for design, development, and product unite so more people
          can be a part of the conversation. At Clarity, we elevate our skills
          through multi-faceted <strong>inclusion</strong>,
          <strong>empathy</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>,
          <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>collaboration</strong>.

          In 2014, I decided to try my hand at organizing a conference. I
          decided to focus the event on design systems since that was my main
          interest. At the time, there were no other events that had this focus.
          &ldquo;Clarity&rdquo; seemed perfect for the name, as it was a word I
          found using quite often in my field.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inspiration for the design aesthetic is diamonds (because
          &ldquo;clarity&rdquo;).

          While I bought the website domain right away, it wasn&rsquo;t until
          2016 that I held the first event. I chose the newly-opened Alamo
          Drafthouse New Mission theatre in San Francisco. I enlisted a few folx
          to help me with a few items (see credits listed). Otherwise, I
          executed everything else. This included planning, coordinating,
          operations, storing, transporting equipment/materials, packing swag
          bags, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          To my delight, Richard Danne keynoted the event. He was the designer
          on the Nasa logo and Graphic Standards Manual from the worm logo era
          (the 70&rsquo;s).

          After the first successful event, I decided to do another one. I used
          the Alamo Drafthouse again, with the attendee count rising closer to
          400. I added workshops to the program this year.

          After 2 years of self-organizing, I realized I needed assistance. The
          event was scaling faster than expected. So I hired a part-time
          assistant (Michael Morrison). He took on some of the vendor
          facilitation, paperwork, and volunteer coordination. Then I could
          focus on the content curation, creative direction, and event
          experience.

          The third event was in New York City at the SVA Theatre. The
          conference had grown to 500 attendees.

          The fourth year, the event was back in San Francisco. This time it was
          at the Blue Shield of California Theatre at YBCA. I needed a larger
          venue since the attendance had outgrown the Alamo Drafthouse. This
          year there were 700 attendees.

          The event attendance has grown year over year. So this year, I opted
          to switch to using an event management company to help me. I partnered
          with Kickass Conferences. This will produce a higher-quality event.

        <p>
          With the 2020 pandemic, the landscape of events has changed. The event
          has evolved into an online experience. I have hopes to provide a
          hybrid experience in future years. This would combine the online and
          in-person experience.

          I moved to the core team to work on design systems across the various

          application designs.

          I helped invent design tokens, which became adopted by the industry as

          I pitched the design system to stakeholders in engineering and design
          leadership, and got buy-in. With the Lightning Design System funded
          and a team formalized, I received a title change to clarify my role. I
          conducted design systems work (which included <abbr title="User
          Experience">UX</abbr> design, visual design, frontend development, and
          documentation). I drafted the team vision and charter and worked

          writing, speaking, and coaching both internal and external people on
          best practices using the design system.

          Sass is a mature, stable, and powerful professional grade <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> extension language. Sass is
          completely compatible with all versions of <abbr title="Cascading
          Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. You can use it with any available <abbr
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> libraries.

          I am a fan of using Sass to process my <abbr title="Cascading
          Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>. I was first introduced to it during my time
          working at Engine Yard. One day, one of the core team members tweeted
          his frustration with the design of the project. He suggested that it
          might be why designers were using a competitor instead. So I
          volunteered to lead the redesign of the brand and website.

          The Apple Online Store was an e-commerce website at store.apple.com.
          The separate website no longer exists as Apple has merged it into the
          marketing website.

          I joined Apple to work on the Online Store right before the launch of
          the first iPhone. I started as a Frontend UI Engineer.
