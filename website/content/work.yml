        <p>
          I was recruited by fellow former Salesforce employees who worked with
          me to join them at Amazon. They wanted me to recreate the success of
          the Salesforce Lightning Design System. In a contract-turned-full-time
          engagement, I worked closely with product designers by providing
          design direction for visuals and interactions. I also worked with
          engineers to ensure their <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> was to
          specifications as well as guidance on accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role also included some design operations as well, including
          provisioning access to the design tools used on the team, project
          management, and providing education and workshops opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time there, I built a React-based style guide with
          components and documentation for both the design and engineering
          organizations to use.

          Clarity is a design systems conference focused on how we work
          together. We&nbsp;provide tools and standards to scale across an
          increasing number of devices, platforms, and&nbsp;products.
          But&nbsp;real success comes when people align around a shared vision
          and language. Diverse&nbsp;perspectives for design, development,
          and&nbsp;product unite so more people can be a part of the
          conversation. At&nbsp;Clarity, we&nbsp;elevate our skills through
          multi-faceted <strong>inclusion</strong>, <strong>empathy</strong>,
          <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>,
          and&nbsp;<strong>collaboration</strong>.

          Design Systems as a full-time job were beginning to become a norm.
          But&nbsp;there weren&rsquo;t too many resources or events dedicated to
          people like&nbsp;us.

        <p>
          I found myself using the word &ldquo;clarity&rdquo; a lot in my work.
          So&nbsp;in 2014, I&nbsp;bought <i>clarityconf.com</i>. But&nbsp;the
          first event wasn&rsquo;t until 2016. It&nbsp;allowed time to consider
          and plan what the event experience should&nbsp;be.

          I organized the conference mostly by myself, with&nbsp;a few
          volunteers and vendors that I directed which included designers,
          a&nbsp;sketch note artist, videographers, photographer, and&nbsp;more.
        </p>
        <p>The event had almost 300&nbsp;attendees.</p>

          The third year, the&nbsp;attendee count grew to 500 and the event was
          in New York City. This&nbsp;was to meet the customer demands of an
          east-coast event. So&nbsp;I hired a part-time assistant.
          I&nbsp;workshopped with a consultant to develop the mission statement
          and principles. And&nbsp;I continued directing creative volunteers
          and&nbsp;vendors.

          Initially expecting 800+ attendees, I&nbsp;switched to investing in an
          event production team to achieve that scale and a higher quality.
          However, with&nbsp;the pandemic, plans&nbsp;changed
          (from&nbsp;in-person to online and attendance forecasted to 500).
          We&rsquo;ve met every week since February and have created what we
          expect to be a high-quality, engaging&nbsp;experience.

          This is some of the work I am most proud of. During my five and a half
          years at Salesforce, I had the opportunity to impact how one of the
          largest enterprise technology companies ship product design.

          I moved to the core team to work on design systems across the various
          products. I worked closely with other product designers to standardize
          and document the design language and specifications for mobile and web
          application designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I helped invent design tokens, which became adopted by the industry as
          a best practice for scaling design in a system.

          I pitched the design system to stakeholders in engineering and design
          leadership, and got buy-in. With the Lightning Design System funded
          and a team formalized, I received a title change to clarify my role. I
          conducted design systems work (which included <abbr title="User
          Experience">UX</abbr> design, visual design, frontend development, and
          documentation). I drafted the team vision and charter and worked
          closely with our team's people manager on planning and presenting our
          goals with the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also led the <abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr>
          organization&rsquo;s evangelism and outreach efforts including being
          the Editor-in-chief for the team blog, the admin for the social media
          accounts, organizer of various meet ups and conference sponsorships,
          writing, speaking, and coaching both internal and external people on
          best practices using the design system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also mentored designers to level up their skills in frontend
          development.

          While Sass was first to market, Less&nbsp;had become more popular with
          designers. Sass&rsquo;s website and brand was not inspiring designers
          to use it. Also, the&nbsp;brand was also controversial&nbsp;(sexist).

          I am a fan of using Sass to process my CSS. I&nbsp;was first
          introduced to it during my time working at Engine Yard. One&nbsp;day,
          one&nbsp;of the core team members tweeted his frustration with the
          design of the project. He&nbsp;suggested that it might be why
          designers were using a competitor instead. So&nbsp;I volunteered to
          lead the redesign of the brand and&nbsp;website.

          The brand has not only been embraced by the community, but&nbsp;many

          The&nbsp;most popular <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>
          framework (Bootstrap) abandoned&nbsp;Less in favor of Sass.
          The&nbsp;United States Web Design System uses it. Hillary&nbsp;Clinton
          even wore a replica of the glasses I drew to hire&nbsp;developers.
