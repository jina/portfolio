  lead: >
    I am super passionate about design systems, design tools, and design
    processes. But more importantly, I enjoy looking at ways to improve
    collaboration and improving communication; I love  community and people.
    It&rsquo;s why I love design systems in the first place. Because
    <strong>design systems are for people</strong>.

workshops:
  - title: Getting Started with Design Systems
    description: >
      An introduction to design systems, along with a plan for getting started.
      This is best for companies who are starting from scratch. Lucky you!
  - title: A Real World Design Systems Workshop
    description: >
      Not everyone is starting from scratch with color palettes. This workshop
      focuses on the real-world practice of design systems, such as inheriting a
      design system, or trying to retrofit one into a legacy product.
