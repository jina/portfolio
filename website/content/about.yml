    I enjoy design systems,Â tools, and&nbsp;processes. More&nbsp;importantly,
    I&nbsp;like looking at ways to improve collaboration and improving
    communication; I&nbsp;love community and people. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;why I love
    design systems in the first place. Because&nbsp;<strong>design systems are
    for&nbsp;people</strong>.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Be open, inclusive, and&nbsp;community-driven. Open&nbsp;source.
            Share&nbsp;what you&nbsp;learn.
          </li>

          <li>
            &ldquo;There is no design system&rdquo;. ðŸ˜œ Or, rather&nbsp;than
            only focusing on the artifact (a&nbsp;style guide website, <abbr
            title="User Interface">UI</abbr>&nbsp;Kit, pattern&nbsp;library,
            etc) &mdash; see&nbsp;Design Systems is a continuous way of thinking
            &amp;&nbsp;working.
          </li>

          <li>
            Technology stacks and tools come and go. Be&nbsp;agnostically-minded
            and&nbsp;future-proof.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Anyone should be empowered to contribute to design&nbsp;systems.
          </li>

          <li>Close gaps (rather&nbsp;than simply bridging&nbsp;them).</li>

          <li>
            Design Systems are more successful with cross-functional
            skills&nbsp;represented.
          </li>

          <li>Avoid&nbsp;silos.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            There is no need to &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; someone to focus only on
            design or only on engineering. Let&nbsp;people shine by using their
            diverse range of&nbsp;skills.
          </li>

          <li>
            The &ldquo;design&rdquo; in design systems is to solve problems for
            the overall experience. Everyone&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;that.
          </li>

          <li>
            Designers who code and coders who design are able to show their work
            in exciting ways. Let&rsquo;s&nbsp;embrace&nbsp;that.
          </li>
        </ul>

      description: >
        <ul>
          <li>
            To get buy-in, don&rsquo;t&nbsp;just talk about potential.
            Show&nbsp;examples and concepts. Prove&nbsp;it with visible outcomes
            and incremental&nbsp;progress.
          </li>

          <li>
            Rather than aiming for massive impact that takes awhile,
            focus&nbsp;on the incremental wins. The&nbsp;smaller success stories
            cultivate adoption&nbsp;faster.
          </li>

          <li>Share the vision with everyone. (Posters&nbsp;can&nbsp;help!)</li>

invite: >
  <p>
    I love speaking at conferences! If&nbsp;you would like to invite me to speak
    at your event, please&nbsp;review the following&nbsp;details.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I only speak at conferences that have an actionable and enforced Code
      of&nbsp;Conduct.
    </li>
    <li>
      I require travel expenses to be covered by the event. I&nbsp;prefer doing
      this as a reimbursement so that I can book my own travel.
    </li>
    <li>
      I require an honorarium (speaking&nbsp;fee). If&nbsp;you are a non-profit,
      we&nbsp;can discuss terms to make the engagement&nbsp;possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      When contacting me, please&nbsp;let me know what actions you are taking to
      ensure a diverse and inclusive&nbsp;event.

workshops:
  - title: Getting Started with Design&nbsp;Systems
    description: >
      An introduction to design systems, along with a plan for getting started.
      This is best for companies who are starting from scratch. Lucky&nbsp;you!
  - title: A Real World Design Systems&nbsp;Workshop
    description: >
      Not everyone is starting from scratch with color palettes.
      This&nbsp;workshop focuses on the real-world practice of design systems,
      such&nbsp;as inheriting a design system, or&nbsp;trying to retrofit one
      into a legacy&nbsp;product.
