  I enjoy design systems, tools, and&nbsp;processes. More&nbsp;importantly,
  I&nbsp;like looking at ways to improve collaboration and improving
  communication; I&nbsp;love community and people. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;why I love
  design systems in the first place. Because **design systems are
  for&nbsp;people**.
philosophy: >
  ## My Outlook

  ### Design systems are _for_&nbsp;people

  - Be open, inclusive, and&nbsp;community-driven. Open&nbsp;source.
    Share&nbsp;what you&nbsp;learn.

  - &ldquo;There is no design system&rdquo;. ðŸ˜œ Or, rather&nbsp;than only
    focusing on the artifact (a&nbsp;style guide website, <abbr title="User
    Interface">UI</abbr>&nbsp;Kit, pattern&nbsp;library, etc) &mdash;
    see&nbsp;Design Systems is a continuous way of thinking &amp;&nbsp;working.

  - Technology stacks and tools come and go. Be&nbsp;agnostically-minded
    and&nbsp;future-proof.

  ### Design Systems are a shared&nbsp;ownership

  - Anyone should be empowered to contribute to design&nbsp;systems.

  - Close gaps (rather&nbsp;than simply bridging&nbsp;them).

  - Design Systems are more successful with cross-functional
    skills&nbsp;represented.

  - Avoid&nbsp;silos.

  ### Hybrids have a place in design&nbsp;systems

  - There is no need to &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; someone to focus only on design or
    only on engineering. Let&nbsp;people shine by using their diverse range
    of&nbsp;skills.

  - The &ldquo;design&rdquo; in design systems is to solve problems for the
    overall experience. Everyone&nbsp;impacts&nbsp;that.

  - Designers who code and coders who design are able to show their work in
    exciting ways. Let&rsquo;s&nbsp;embrace&nbsp;that.

  ### Show. Don&rsquo;t&nbsp;tell.

  - To get buy-in, don&rsquo;t&nbsp;just talk about potential.
    Show&nbsp;examples and concepts. Prove&nbsp;it with visible outcomes and
    incremental&nbsp;progress.

  - Rather than aiming for massive impact that takes awhile, focus&nbsp;on the
    incremental wins. The&nbsp;smaller success stories cultivate
    adoption&nbsp;faster.

  - Share the vision with everyone. (Posters&nbsp;can&nbsp;help!)

  ### Invite Me to&nbsp;Speak

  I love speaking at conferences! If&nbsp;you would like to invite me to speak
  at your event, please&nbsp;review the following&nbsp;details.

  - I only speak at conferences that have an actionable and enforced Code
    of&nbsp;Conduct.

  - I require travel expenses to be covered by the event. I&nbsp;prefer doing
    this as a reimbursement so that I can book my own travel.

  - I require an honorarium (speaking&nbsp;fee). If&nbsp;you are a non-profit,
    we&nbsp;can discuss terms to make the engagement&nbsp;possible.

  - When contacting me, please&nbsp;let me know what actions you are taking to
    ensure a diverse and inclusive&nbsp;event.

workshops:
  - title: Getting Started with Design&nbsp;Systems
    description: >
      An introduction to design systems, along with a plan for getting started.
      This is best for companies who are starting from scratch. Lucky&nbsp;you!
  - title: A Real World Design Systems&nbsp;Workshop
    description: >
      Not everyone is starting from scratch with color palettes.
      This&nbsp;workshop focuses on the real-world practice of design systems,
      such&nbsp;as inheriting a design system, or&nbsp;trying to retrofit one
      into a legacy&nbsp;product.
